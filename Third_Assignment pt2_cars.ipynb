    "# Presentation of the problem (6 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I decided to create a machine learning model that can predict which country their car was manufactured in. Although many people could instantly know which country their car was manufactured through their car model I wanted to create this classifier as something that someone can use out of curiosity to see what country their car originated from. This classifier might be helpful for individuals who are not into cars that much and might not even know about different car models and where they are manufactured. Another potential application for this problem is for car part companies that store many different car parts. Having this classifier might help car repair companies perform a initial diagnosis of a individuals car (knowing where the car was manufactured could help with identifying what repair parts will be needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this ML model I will be analysing the mpg dataset which contains information about 38 new car models which have been released every year from 1999 and 2008. I will be using the milers per gallon -mpg, car displacement, horsepower, and car weight. The reason why I picked these variables is because I believe that they might have a correlation with being manufactured at a specific country (for example cars manufactured from the US might have lower mpg or horsepower). I briefly explored the mpg dataset in the \"python part 1\" course and noticed that the US manufactured cars that had lower mpg's, displacements, etc when compared to other countries. Seeing these results sparked my curiosity to classification algorithm that can predict where a car is manufactured by just taking in a few stats about the car."

    "I have definded the dataset columns below and have also indicated what type of variable it is (ex. categorical or numerical):\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **mpg** -continuous numerical:\n",
    "      *   mpg means miles per gallon and it is the distance of each car measured in miles. It is referred to the *fuel economy* of a car since it represents the amount travelled by the car and the amount of fuel consumed. A *higher* mpg is better since it shows that your car can consume less fuel as you drive.\n",
    "*   **cylinders** -nominal categorical:\n",
    "      *   A car cylinder is a important part of the engine. This is where fuel is consumed and the car's energy is generated. If a car has *more* cylinders that means the cars power can be generated *faster*. However, there is a tradeoff to this since you need more fuel to generate more power. So if your care has more cylinders then you will end up paying for more fuel.\n",
    "*    **displacement** -continuous numerical:\n",
    "      *  A cars displacement refers to the amount of air that can be pushed into the cylinders. The higher the engine displacement the more power the engine can generate.\n",
    "*    **horsepower** -discrete numerical:\n",
    "      *  The cars horsepower is a measurment of how fast a cars engine can work. The more horsepower a car has the faster it can go\n",
    "*    **weight** -continuous numerical:\n",
    "      *  Car weight. The heavier a car, the more fuel it requires\n",
    "*    **acceleration** -continuous numerical:\n",
    "      *  Acceleration describes the rate at which the car can increase its speed. Having a high car acceleration will use more fuel\n",
    "*    **model_year** -ordinal categorical:\n",
    "      *  Gives the year the car was made/manufactured\n",
    "*    **origin** -nominal categorical:\n",
    "      *  Where the car was manufactured\n",

    "After looking and analysing the results of each classification model I would say that the Random Forest classfier was the best model to correctly classify all of the car's country of manufactuting. First off, the Random Forest classifier has a accuracy score of 1 on the training data which was suprising since I never imagined that it would be able to correctly classify all of the car's country of origin. Even though the Random Forest accuracy decreased on the test data by 0.25 the accuracy was still the highest compared to the logistic regression and SVM (although the accuracy scores of these two algorithms were not far off from the random forest since they were both 0.70).\n",
    "\n",
    "I was leaning towards saying that all of the models were fairly accurate since on the test data, the accuracy scores were not too far off. But when looking at the confusion matrix results I realised that none of the models was able to correctly classify the cars that were manufactured in Europe. The Random Forest classifier was able to correctly identify Europe as the car's manufactured place in both, the training and test datasets. Similarily, you notice that the F1 scores for Europe in the Random Forest classifier is the highest in the training and testing data while the logistic regression and SVM both had a F1 score of zero for Europe."
