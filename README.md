# Oxford-Python-pt-1-2

I have attached the assignments that I submitted for the Oxford University Department for Continuing Education Python courses (part 1 & 2). Part 1 of the course was a introduction to python programming, where I learned how to deal with structured and unstructured data using python. Part 2 focused on machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing using python. 

# Python Programming for Data Science - Part 1 Syllabus Overview

## Week 1: Introduction to Data Science. Introduction to Git and the Anaconda environment
[Week 1 Assignment](https://github.com/hsarfraz/Oxford-Python-pt-1-2/blob/main/1.1_week1_assignment.ipynb)

* Where Python is used (**bolded** words are projects I need to try)
  * Web Dev: Frameworks such as Django & Flask
  * **Data Analysis**: Libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**
  * **Internet of Things**: **Raspberry pi**, **TinyML IoT Devices**
  * Web Scraping: Scrapy
  * Computer Vision: OpenCV
  * **Machine Learning**: **Sci-kit Learn**, NLTK, **TensorFlow**
  * Game Dev: PyGame

### Variable Types in Python

* Numeric Types
  * int: These are whole numbers (ex. 10, 30, 40, etc.)
  * float: These are decimal numbers (ex. 10.6, 4.5, 67.8, etc.)
* Text Types
  * str: words and sentences (ex. 'Hello', 'Nick', etc.)
* Boolean Types
  * bool: True of False values -keep note of the uppercase
* NoneType 
  * NoneType: used to represent nothing -called None

### Different ways to print outputs (print w/ commas vs. concatenation)

* print w/ commas -a space is automatically assigned
  * Input: `print("Hello", "World)`
  * Output: Hello World
* concatenation: joining two statements together -a space is not assigned
  * Input: `print("Hello" + "World)`
  * Output: HelloWorld

### Static vs. Dynamic Languages

* Python is **dynamically typed** (type checked at run-time). The variables can initially be assigned a value of one type, and then be reassigned a value of a different type
* **Statically typed** languages (ex. C, C++, C#, Java) checks types at compile-time and only allows values of the same type to be assigned

### Sequence, Selection, Iteration

* Sequence: When each statement is executed by order (ie. line by line)
* Selection: Conditional statements that will only execute a block of code once, if it is true
* Iteration: Can repeat certain statements within a block, while the statement is true

## Week 2: Python basics: built-in types, functions and methods, if statement

Week 2 will focus on these topics:
* Selection
* Operators
 * Comparison
 * Arithmetic
 * Logical
* Iteration
* Functions 

Selection in Python (if-then-else statements)
* Selection is when Python chooses to execute a certain line of code based on the condition given in the if-then-else statement


Week 3: Python data structures: list, dictionaries, tuples; for...in loops

Week 4: NumPy

Week 5: Pandas for data science I 

Week 6: Pandas for data science II

Week 7: Matplotlib for Data visualisation

Week 8: Object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, and applications 

Week 9: Data gathering and cleaning. Text pre-processing for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Week 10: Introduction to experimental design
