# Oxford-Python-pt-1-2

I have attached the assignments that I submitted for the Oxford University Department for Continuing Education Python courses (part 1 & 2). Part 1 of the course was a introduction to python programming, where I learned how to deal with structured and unstructured data using python. Part 2 focused on machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing using python. 

# Python Programming for Data Science - Part 1 Syllabus Overview

## Week 1: Introduction to Data Science. Introduction to Git and the Anaconda environment

* Where Python is used (**bolded** words are projects I need to try)
  * Web Dev: Frameworks such as Django & Flask
  * **Data Analysis**: Libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**
  * **Internet of Things**: **Raspberry pi**, **TinyML IoT Devices**
  * Web Scraping: Scrapy
  * Computer Vision: OpenCV
  * **Machine Learning**: **Sci-kit Learn**, NLTK, **TensorFlow**
  * Game Dev: PyGame

### Variable Types in Python

* Numeric Types
  * int: These are whole numbers (ex. 10, 30, 40, etc.)
  * float: These are decimal numbers (ex. 10.6, 4.5, 67.8, etc.)
* Text Types
  * str: words and sentences (ex. 'Hello', 'Nick', etc.)
* Boolean Types
  * bool: True of False values -keep note of the uppercase
* NoneType 
  * NoneType: used to represent nothing -called None

### Different ways to print outputs (print w/ commas vs. concatenation)

* print w/ commas -a space is automatically assigned

###### Input
```Python
print("Hello", "World)
```
###### Output
```Python
Hello World
```
* concatenation: joining two statements together -a space is not assigned

###### Input
```Python
print("Hello" + "World)
```
###### Output
```Python
HelloWorld
```
Week 2: Python basics: built-in types, functions and methods, if statement

Week 3: Python data structures: list, dictionaries, tuples; for...in loops

Week 4: NumPy

Week 5: Pandas for data science I 

Week 6: Pandas for data science II

Week 7: Matplotlib for Data visualisation

Week 8: Object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, and applications 

Week 9: Data gathering and cleaning. Text pre-processing for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Week 10: Introduction to experimental design
