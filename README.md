# Oxford-Python-pt-1-2

I have attached the assignments that I submitted for the Oxford University Department for Continuing Education Python courses (part 1 & 2). Part 1 of the course was a introduction to python programming, where I learned how to deal with structured and unstructured data using python. Part 2 focused on machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing using python.
